    <h2>Why Is it Important to Know About Computer Programming?</h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger; padding-left: 15px;">
        Technology production is an essential part of an evolving world. 
        This means that computer programming is exceptionally important for our future as a global society. Computer programming degree graduates can help create this future by automating processes, collecting data, analyzing information and sharing knowledge to continuously innovate and improve upon existing processes.

        This means that, while computer programming is extremely important today, it may be even more impactful in the future. As computer programmers across the world work to learn new ways of communicating with machines and computers, the field will continue to grow. Earning your computer programming degree now means you can be part of that research and testing to develop functions that can help society.
        
        Computer programming is important today because so much of our world is automated. Humans need to be able to control the interaction between people and machines. Since computers and machines are able to do things so efficiently and accurately, we use computer programming to harness that computing power.

    <p style="font-size: larger; padding-left: 15px;">
        Computer programming is evolving and so are the languages that are used to develop software and applications. Different programming languages are used for different categories of developers. Some languages are best for beginners, while others are more suited for advanced computer programmers. In addition, some languages are best for different use cases such as web apps, mobile apps and distributed systems.
        <br>
        The best way to determine what programming languages to learn is to know what skills you will need in order to be a successful computer programmer.
        <br>
        Popular and important computer programming languages based on necessity and application include:
       </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>C/C++</li>
            <li>others</li>
        </ul>
    <p style="font-size: larger; padding-left: 15px;">
        Each of these language ranges in usability and ease of learning. Python is considered the best beginner programming language. It is easy to learn and to deploy. Java has been a popular language for many decades. It is the official language for Android apps. C and C++ are considered the foundational languages for many operating systems and file systems. JavaScript is popular for front end developers because it helps make applications look clean and clear for the user. Swift is a native iOS language and has been growing in popularity as Mac and Apple products become industry favorites.
