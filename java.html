    <h2>what is Java ?</h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger; padding-left: 15px;">
        Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
        <br> It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere, meaning that compiled Java code 
        can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>why is it important?</h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger; padding-left: 15px;">
        The expansion of the Java programming language is very wide and it is proved by the statement 3 Billion Devices Runs Java 
        which is shown during the installation of Java. Java provides a rich and wide range of API that helps programmers to develop applications. 
        <br>Using Java, we can develop different applications for different purposes. We can use Java technology to develop 
        <br>the following applications:
